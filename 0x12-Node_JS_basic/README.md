At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/MghxS7d1VjAonNuZqEZ1Tw "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google**:

-   run javascript using NodeJS
-   use NodeJS modules
-   use specific Node JS module to read files
-   use  `process`  to access command line arguments and the environment
-   create a small HTTP server using Node JS
-   create a small HTTP server using Express JS
-   create advanced routes with Express JS
-   use ES6 with Node JS with Babel-node
-   use Nodemon to develop faster

## Requirements
